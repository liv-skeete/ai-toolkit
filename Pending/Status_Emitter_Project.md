 🤔 Chosing best mode... [SMR/SMR_v1_Module.py - routing the chat model]

 👍 Response received [Anthropic/Antropic_Pipeline.py - non-streaming response received - "done": True]
 . [MRS/AMS_MRS_v4_Module.py - processing memories - status clearing 4s delay - "done": True]
 🎉 Image generation successful [Venice_Image/Venice_Image_v2.py - generated image - "done": True]

This is what a turn looks like in the Open WebUI status UI [@/_scratchpad.md], inside [] I explain the originating module, purpose and the completion status. The "done": True flag simply changes the UI to static instead of pulsing. Here is the Open WebUI dosucmention on events for refence [Reference/OW_Events.md].

This status system is separate from the similar citation system which puts events in a citation modal at the end of the message. These status message stream across the top of the chat UI as they happen and are very valuable feedback to use. 

The issue is the status system is fragile and easily broken, each module emmits status with no knowledge of the others, they are all fire and forget. I would like to rationlize the status system, standadize methods of use and code naming and fix multiple bugs.

Bugs:
- If AMS_MRS_v4_Module.py does place the status clearing event with 4s delay the "🏁 Memory processing complete" message shows in stauts but when the page is refreshed it disapperes leaving "💾 Saving memories..." in active state. The clearing code is a workaround we want to fix.
- Image generation can be long lived and final comleteion places after clearing event. Issue goes away when prior bug is resolved.
- 

Fearute:
- If the last status event was "🎯 32108 Tokens read from cache" this would be ideal so users become cache and token use aware.
