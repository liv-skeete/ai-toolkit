# MIS CRUD Responsibility: Recommendation & Rationale

## Core Question

**Should the LLM ever recommend a CRUD operation, or should it only provide semantic scores, best matches, and reasoning, leaving all CRUD decisions to deterministic code?**

---

## Recommendation: Semantic-Only LLM, Deterministic CRUD in Code

### 1. LLM Responsibilities

- **Semantic Analysis Only:**  
  - For each potential memory, output:
    - Content, category, importance
    - Relevance scores to all existing memories (with IDs)
    - Best match (ID, score)
    - Reasoning for each score
    - Explicit flags for deletion/negation cases (with target description)
- **No CRUD Recommendations:**  
  - The LLM does NOT output "CREATE", "UPDATE", "DELETE", or similar CRUD ops.
  - All "intelligent" business logic (e.g., what counts as a match, how to score, what is a negation) is handled in the prompt.

### 2. Code Responsibilities

- **Minimal, Deterministic CRUD Mapping:**  
  - For each potential memory:
    - If explicit deletion/negation:  
      - If target is a specific item: UPDATE (remove item)
      - If target is an entire memory: DELETE
    - Else:
      - If best match relevance >= memory_relevance_threshold: UPDATE/MERGE with best match
      - If < threshold: CREATE new memory
  - All thresholds, merge policies, and CRUD mapping are explicit, stable, and rarely changed.
- **Immutability:**  
  - The code is logic-agnostic and only needs to be updated for structural or performance reasons, not for business logic changes.

## Rationale

- **LLM Strengths:**  
  - Semantic similarity, category assignment, nuanced reasoning, and edge-case detection.
- **LLM Weaknesses:**  
  - Deterministic thresholding, CRUD mapping, and stateful logic (especially with small models).
- **Code Strengths:**  
  - Deterministic, auditable, and robust execution of simple rules.
- **Code Weaknesses:**  
  - Complex, evolving business logic is hard to maintain and test in code.

- **Maintainability:**  
  - All business logic and edge-case handling can be evolved by updating prompts, not code.
  - Code is stable, reliable, and easy to test.
- **Robustness:**  
  - No risk of LLM hallucinating or misapplying CRUD ops.
  - All CRUD decisions are auditable and deterministic.

## Example Flow

1. **LLM Output:**
   - "Potential memory: 'User likes jazz', importance: 0.8"
   - "Best match: [ID: mem123], relevance: 0.85"
   - "Reasoning: High semantic similarity, same category"
2. **Code:**
   - If relevance >= 0.7: UPDATE mem123 with new info
   - If relevance < 0.7: CREATE new memory
   - If explicit deletion: DELETE or UPDATE as per flag

---

## Edge Cases

- **Ambiguous LLM Output:**  
  - Code falls back to CREATE and logs a warning.
- **Threshold Changes:**  
  - Only code config needs to be updated, not logic.

## Summary Table

| Task | LLM (Prompt) | Code (Module) |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| Semantic analysis, scoring, best match | X |   |
| CRUD operation mapping |   | X |
| Thresholding, merge policy |   | X |
| Business logic evolution | X (prompt) |   |
| Structural/infra changes |   | X |

## Final Note

This approach maximizes maintainability, robustness, and the ability to evolve the system by prompt engineering, not code changes. It is especially well-suited for modest local LLMs and teams that want stable, immutable code and flexible, prompt-driven business logic.
