# AMM Logging Standardization Project

## Project Overview

This document outlines a plan to standardize and improve the logging system in the Automatic Memory Manager (AMM) module. The goal is to create a consistent, configurable, and reliable logging approach throughout the codebase.

## Key Objectives

1. **Add Log Level Configuration**
   - Implement a new valve in the Valves class for configurable log level
   - Ensure the log level setting is respected throughout the module
   - Allow runtime adjustment of logging verbosity

2. **Standardize Logging Format**
   - Complete the conversion to %-style formatting for all logging statements
   - Establish consistent formatting patterns for different types of log messages
   - Ensure no direct logging of raw external content

3. **Implement Consistent Exception Handling**
   - Create a standardized approach for logging exceptions
   - Define patterns for including/excluding tracebacks based on severity
   - Ensure proper context is included with all error messages

4. **Establish Log Level Guidelines**
   - Define clear criteria for each log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
   - Review and adjust all existing log statements to follow these guidelines
   - Document the guidelines for future maintenance

5. **Enhance Safety for External Data**
   - Identify all sources of external data in the module
   - Implement consistent safety practices for logging this data
   - Add safeguards to prevent format string vulnerabilities

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will be methodical and systematic, focusing on one component at a time to minimize the risk of introducing new issues. We'll start with adding the log level valve, then proceed with standardizing the logging format, and finally address the exception handling and log level guidelines.

This project will improve code maintainability, debugging capabilities, and overall reliability of the AMM module while preserving all existing functionality.

## Additional Note about Format String Fix

There was an issue where JSON content containing curly braces and colons (e.g., {"text": "exact memory text", "score": 0.85}) caused Python to interpret them as format specifiers in log messages, raising an "Invalid format specifier" error. We fixed this by doubling curly braces in code segments and/or using safer logging approaches (e.g., using %r or escaping braces). It is important to retain this fix, especially whenever we modify or expand the logging system, to avoid reintroducing the same vulnerability.

## Implementation Status (2025-03-05)

The logging standardization project has been successfully implemented in version 0.3.7 of the Automatic Memory Manager. The following improvements have been made:

1. **Added Log Level Configuration**
   - Added a new `log_level` valve in the Valves class for configurable log level
   - Added a `log_truncate_length` valve to control content truncation length
   - Implemented a `_configure_logger` method to apply log level settings
   - Added an `update_valves` method to allow runtime adjustment of logging settings

2. **Implemented Safe Logging Helpers**
   - Added `_safe_log_content` helper method for content truncation and formatting
   - Added `_safe_log_exception` helper method for consistent exception logging
   - Implemented proper escaping of format string characters (%)

3. **Applied Log Level Filtering**
   - Updated all logging calls to respect the configured log level
   - Moved verbose logging to DEBUG level
   - Kept important status information at INFO level
   - Ensured errors are properly logged at ERROR level

4. **Enhanced Content Truncation**
   - Applied truncation to all large data structures in logs
   - Implemented smart formatting for different data types (lists, dicts, etc.)
   - Added full content logging at DEBUG level when needed

5. **Fixed Format String Vulnerabilities**
   - Ensured all external content is properly escaped before logging
   - Replaced direct content logging with safe alternatives
   - Added explicit escaping for % characters in API responses

These changes have significantly reduced the amount of log output during memory operations while still providing the necessary information for debugging when needed. The code is now more maintainable, safer, and provides better control over logging verbosity.
