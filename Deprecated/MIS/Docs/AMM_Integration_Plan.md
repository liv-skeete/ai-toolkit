# Integration Plan for AMM Modules

## Overview
The goal is to integrate `AMM_MIS_v16_Module.py`, `AMM_MRE_v5_Module.py`, and `AMM_MMC_v3_Module.py` into a cohesive memory management system.

## Components
1. **Unified Configuration System**
   - Implement a centralized configuration management system.
   - Allow for the configuration of valves across all modules from a single interface.

2. **Memory Management Pipeline**
   - Design a workflow that sequentially or parallelly executes the functionalities of `AMM_MIS`, `AMM_MRE`, and `AMM_MMC`.
   - Ensure that the output of one module can be used as input for another where necessary.

3. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Implement an event-driven system where modules react to specific events.
   - Events could include new user messages, requests for memory consolidation, etc.

4. **Shared Utilities and Models**
   - Identify and refactor common code and models (e.g., `Memories` model) to be shared across modules.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Analysis and Planning**: Further analyze the modules to identify any potential roadblocks or areas requiring significant refactoring.
2. **Unified Configuration Implementation**: Design and implement the unified configuration system.
3. **Pipeline Design**: Create a detailed design for the memory management pipeline, including how data will flow between modules.
4. **Event-Driven Architecture Implementation**: Set up the event-driven architecture, ensuring that each module can listen for and respond to relevant events.
5. **Refactoring for Shared Utilities**: Refactor common utilities and models to be accessible across all modules.

    A[User Message] -->|Triggers|> B(AMM_MIS)
    B -->|Identified Memories|> C(AMM_MRE)
    C -->|Enhanced Prompt|> D[User Interaction]
    D -->|Consolidation Request|> E(AMM_MMC)
    E -->|Consolidated Memories|> F[Memory Database]
    B -->|Stored Memories|> F
    C -->|Retrieved Memories|> F
```

## Next Steps
- Begin by implementing the unified configuration system to simplify module configuration.
- Proceed with designing the memory management pipeline, focusing on how the modules will interact.
